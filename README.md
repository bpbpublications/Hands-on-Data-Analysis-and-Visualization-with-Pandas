# Hands-on Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas
Engineer, Analyse and Visualize Data, Using Powerful Python Libraries
 
This is the code repository for [Hands-on Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas](https://bpbonline.com/products/hands-on-data-analysis-and-visualization-with-pandas?_pos=1&_sid=0a2a2b6f5&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book

## About the Book
The book will start with quick introductions to Python and its ecosystem libraries for data science such as JupyterLab, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This book will help in learning python data structures and essential concepts such as Functions, Lambdas, List comprehensions, Datetime objects, etc. required for data engineering. It also covers an in-depth understanding of Python data science packages where JupyterLab used as an IDE for writing, documenting, and executing the python code, Numpy used for computation of numerical operations, Pandas for cleaning and reorganizing the data, handling large datasets and merging the dataframes to get meaningful insights. You will go through the statistics to understand the relation between the variables using SciPy and building visualization charts using Matplotllib and Seaborn libraries.

## What will you learn
* Learn about Python data containers, their methods, and attributes.
* Learn Numpy arrays for the computation of numerical data.
* Learn Pandas data structures, DataFrames, and Series.
* Learn statistics measures of central tendency, central limit theorem, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
* A brief understanding of visualization, control, and draw different inbuilt charts to extract important variables, detect outliers, and anomalies using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
